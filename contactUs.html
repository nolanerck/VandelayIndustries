            Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,
            Lives in a dream
            Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
            Who is it for?
            
            All the lonely people
            Where do they all come from?
            All the lonely people
            Where do they all belong?
            
            Father Mckenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
            No one comes near.
            Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
            What does he care?
            
            All the lonely people
            Where do they all come from?
            All the lonely people
            Where do they all belong?
            
            Ah, look at all the lonely people
            Ah, look at all the lonely people
            
            Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
            Nobody came
            Father Mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
            No one was saved
            
            All the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people)
            Where do they all come from?
            All the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people)
            Where do they all belong?
